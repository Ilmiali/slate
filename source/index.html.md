# Setting up Tweak template
##Installing Tweak server
Templates come with local instance of Tweak server. Tweak requires a server to serve the page, which Tweak can then access through the browser. In theory Tweak can be used with any server, however only with Tweak server is it possible to use save and live reload features.

Download and extract a template to a location of your choice.

To install the server instance of the template execute using a termincal or command line from the template folder:

`npm install`
##Starting Tweak server
To start the server and serve the Tweak template on your browser execute from the template folder:

`npm start`

This will serve the page at the address: `http://localhost:8080`

#Editing a page
Make sure you have Tweak server running and serving a Tweak template. 

Simple click the Tweak browser icon to start editing the page with Tweak.

Now all the elements in the page are editable in the browser.

#Customizing a Tweak template
To truly get the full benefit of Tweak, you need some HTML and CSS knowledge to create your own custom components and sections.

Tweak templates are normal HTML and CSS files, making it very simple to customize.

![alt_text](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/tweak-documentation-assets/Screen+Shot+2017-04-18+at+15.51.34.png)

##Sections

```html
	<div class="section" style="height: 500px">
        <div class="section-inner"></div>
    </div>
```

```css
	.section {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%
  }
```

```css
	.section-inner {
    position: relative;
    max-width: 960px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    height: 100%
  }
```

A section must be a div HTML element, and have the class section. 
The class section has the width 100%, the initial height of the section must be defined in the sections.html.

Inner section is a child of section. It has the maximum width of 960px and is the container of components. 
On hand held devices inner section is 100%, any component outside itâ€™s width borders on the mobile view is not drawn on the screen.


##Adding a custom section
Launch the Tweak server of the template that you want to customize and on the browser click on the Tweak browser action. Go to the directory the templates directory. Open sections.html in code editor of your choice.

On sections.html are listed all the sections of the Tweak template. Add a section with the height 750px. 

Add nice gradient background to the section by giving it a child div with the class nice-gradient. In the main.css add new style for the nice-gradient.

```html
	<div class="section" style="height: 750px">
        <div class="nice-gradient"></div>
        <div class="section-inner"></div>
    </div>
```

```css
	.nice-gradient {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
    background-image: linear-gradient(150deg, #3f51b1 0%, #5a55ae 13%, #7b5fac 25%, #8f6aae 38%, #a86aa4 50%, #cc6b8e 62%, #f18271 75%, #f3a469 87%, #f7c978 100%);
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    z-index: -1;
  }
```

Now back on your browser open Tweak add sidebar and open the sections tab, if your sections tab was already open click on the refresh icon.
Your newly added section should appear now there.

##Components

```html
    <div class="component" style="width: 100px">
        <h1 class="logo-text">tweak</h1>
    </div>
```

```css
	.component {
    position: absolute;
  }

  .component img {
    width: 100%;
  }
```

Component is the containing div of elements that can be positioned using Tweak. 
Component is absolutely positioned relative to inner section. 
Component can contain any HTML element (p, div, span, h1, h2, h3, input, button etc).


##Adding a custom element
Launch the Tweak server of the template that you want to customize and on the browser click on the Tweak browser action. Go to the directory the templates directory. Open components.html in code editor of your choice.

On compnents.html are listed all the elements of the Tweak template. 
Add a component with the width 200px and an anchor child element with the class example-button.

In the main.css add new style for the example-button.

```html
	<div class="component" style="width: 200px">
        <a href="" class="example-button">Example button</a>
    </div>
```

```css
	.example-button {
    color: #3f51b1;
    white-space: nowrap;
    display: inline-block;
    height: 40px;
    line-height: 40px;
    padding: 0;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(50, 50, 93, .11), 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, .08);
    background: #fff;
    border-radius: 4px;
    font-size: 15px;
    font-weight: 600;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    letter-spacing: .025em;
    width: 100%;
    text-decoration: none;
    text-align: center;
  }
```

Now back on your browser open Tweak add sidebar and open the elements tab, if your elements tab was already open click on the refresh icon.
Your newly added element should appear now there.

##Editing CSS with livereload

Tweak fully supports editing the projects CSS in a code editor of your choice. Infact this is the reccomended way of using Tweak. 
You can also use CSS preprocessor of your choice (LESS, SASS, etc) as long as the output CSS is saved on the css folder.

Tweak server listens for changes in the CSS folder and when it detects them it will notify the browser and the CSS stylesheets will be reloaded automatically on the served page.
